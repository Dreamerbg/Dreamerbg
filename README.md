### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This filter is mainly based on the Kruszard's PD2 Loot filter - https://github.com/Kryszard-POD/Kryszard-s-PD2-Loot-Filter
It is enhanced with some features from Kassahi's loot filter - https://github.com/KassahiPD2/Kassahi such as:
- Map Imunities listed on Maps
- Torch and Annihilus stats listed in their names after identified
- Runwords with the actual runes listed on bases
- Stat requirements on items if you are to upgrade them
- Removed some generally not needed items from notificiations (unless you play a specific build) 
- - Season 4 PD2 uniq items

### Season 5 READY filter with the following changes: 
- Added new uniques and misc items
- Added new dungeon and maps
- Adjusted gold rules
- Added the new runewords in the bases
- Added weapon speeds and range   (Thanks to eqN)

### Loot Filter General info:
 It uses Kruszard's notifications and information on items as a baseline. For example : https://i.imgur.com/wDIwNFa.jpeg
 On top of that it adds more information on items such as weapon speed and range. Possible runewords (with runes listed in correct order): https://i.imgur.com/07aF2Cy.png
 Also notifies about runes 10+ since they are needed for map rerolls and flawless gems. 
 All of the above feature make the filter more casual player oriented :)
