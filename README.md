### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This filter is mainly based on the Kruszard's PD2 Loot filter - https://github.com/Kryszard-POD/Kryszard-s-PD2-Loot-Filter
It is enhanced with some features from Kassahi's loot filter - https://github.com/KassahiPD2/Kassahi such as:
- Map Imunities listed on Maps
- Torch and Annihilus stats listed in their names after identified
- Runwords with the actual runes listed on bases
- Stat requirements on items if you are to upgrade them
- Removed some generally not needed items from notificiations (unless you play a specific build) 
- - Season 4 PD2 uniq items

### Season 5 changes 
- Added new uniques and misc items
- Added new dungeon and maps
- Added new gold rules
- Added the new runewords in the bases
- Added weapon speeds and range   (Thanks to eqN)
